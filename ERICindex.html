    <h4>E.R.I.C. Site Redesign</h4>

    <p class="Project-text">This is an "in progress" project to redesign E.R.I.C.'s website to be a more effective communication and education tool. E.R.I.C., Early Recognition Is Critical, is a 501 (c)(3) non-profit organization that teaches children cancer awareness through the vehicle of ultimate frisbee clinics in schools. Their goal is to reach 1 million kids worldwide by 2020. </p>

    <p class="Project-text">I am working with the Director of Operations and the Director of Business Development to redesign their site branding and architecture. The E.R.I.C. team is writing the site content, identifying primary users, and providing site analytics.</p>

    <p class="Project-text">My role is to use UX/UI research and design to inform the architecture of the website and make it easy for users to find the information they need. As the UX design and research strategist for the team, I am:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Researching: User interviews, usability testing, web analytics</li>
      <li>Designining: Sketches/wireframes. high-fidelity prototypes</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>The Problem</h5>

    <p class="Project-text">When I first met this client, their site was pieced together haphazardly and did not communicate clearly because of both issues with content and site architecture. Analytics showed a bounce rate of 49.9% from the homepage and 62% of sessions on the site lasting less than 10 seconds. </p>

    <p class="Project-text">This matters because E.R.I.C.'s website is one of their only ways that schools and volunteers can find more information about what they do and how to participate. If half of their site traffic is leaving because they canâ€™t easily and quickly find answers, that is detrimental to their mission. </p>
    
    <h5>The Research</h5>
    <p class="Project-text">E.R.I.C. identified school administrators and parents as primary users, as they are the impetus in getting an E.R.I.C. clinic to their school or their child's school. Ultimate players are also very important users to them because they spread the word and volunteer most often as members of the community.</p>

    <img id="ERIC-persona" src="ERIC persona.001.jpeg">

    <p class="Project-text">In interviews with school administrators (teachers, deans/principles) I found that upon hearing about E.R.I.C., this type of user would want to visit the site to learn about the organization's mission and verify its legitimacy. If these users were persuaded that this was a worthwhile mission and it was being carried out responsibly, then they may be inclined to take action (host a clinic). </p>

    <p class="Project-text">When performing usability testing with primary users on the original site, the users ran into several obstacles when simply trying to find more information on the organization. They expected information to be on certain pages where it wasn't and had trouble finding answers to  fundamental questions about the organization. There were mislabeled pages, confusing content, and dead ends. Time and time again the user said they'd leave out of frustration within the first few page loads. Analytics supported this story. There was a clear and common flow pattern from the homepage towards the "Who We Are" and "What We Do" pages, and a majority of sessions that ended within 1-10 seconds. It became clear that both site content and architecture needed a facelift.</p>

    <h5>The Design</h5>
    
   <p class="Project-text">I laid out the site architecture and proposed new header navigation titles so we could properly categorize and organize all site pages. In the original site, users didn't know where to find out how to get invovled. The addition of a "Get Involved" navigation dropdown clarifies where to click.</p>

    <p class="Project-text">I sketched the first round of wireframes to get feedback and make sure everyone was on the same page using Invision. Here are some of the sketches from this stage.</p>

  <p class="Project-text">The E.R.I.C. team and I went through a few rounds of feedback and iteration. I used InvisionApp to create working prototypes for feedback and testing. </p>

  <h5>Next Steps</h5>
  <p class="Project-text">Final rounds of user testing will tell us whether items are easy to find for users.</p>
